Trajectory.js
=============
*************

### Demo
A demonstration of the program is available on my [Dropbox account](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/42030209/rough/arrow/demo.html). A modern browser that implements the HTML5 `<canvas>` element is required - I personally recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). 

### Explanation
This program is designed to compute the trajectories of projectiles and generate graphs inside your browser!
